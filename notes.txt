1. Identity & Relationships
These keys define what the project is and how it relates to other projects (like setup and teardown).

name: A unique string name for the project. Used for filtering in the CLI (e.g., --project=firefox).

dependencies: An array of project names that must run and pass before this project starts. Great for global setup (e.g., dependencies: ['setup']).

teardown: The name of a project that should run after this project finishes. Useful for database cleanup.

2. Test Discovery & Selection
These keys control which specific files or tests belong to this project.

testDir: The directory where this project's tests are located.

testMatch: A glob pattern, regular expression, or an array of them to include specific files.

testIgnore: A glob pattern or regular expression to exclude specific files.

grep: A regular expression to filter tests by their title.

grepInvert: A regular expression to exclude tests by their title.

3. Execution & Retries
These keys control how the tests are physically executed.

use: An object containing browser and context options (e.g., browserName, headless, viewport, baseURL). This is the most commonly used key.

retries: The maximum number of times to retry a failed test in this project.

timeout: The maximum time (in milliseconds) a single test in this project can run.

fullyParallel: A boolean (true/false) to decide if tests in this project should run in parallel.

4. Output & Metadata
These keys manage the artifacts and data generated by the tests.

outputDir: The folder where artifacts like screenshots and videos are saved for this project.

metadata: An object for custom data you want to associate with the project (visible in some reporters).

snapshotDir: The base directory for reference snapshots.

snapshotPathTemplate: A template string to customize where screenshots/snapshots are saved.



Pattern,Where it looks
*.setup.js,Only in the root folder (does not look inside folders).
tests/**/*.setup.js,Only inside the tests folder and its subdirectories.
"**/*.{setup,teardown}.js",Finds files ending in either .setup.js or .teardown.js.



//FINAL
1. Root Level (Global Settings)
These properties control the overall execution of the test runner. They are defined at the top level of the defineConfig object
Property,Description
testDir,The directory where Playwright looks for test files.
timeout,"Maximum time (in ms) a single test can run. Default is 30,000."
expect,"Global configuration for assertions (e.g., { timeout: 5000 })."
fullyParallel,Whether to run all tests in all files in parallel.
forbidOnly,Fails the build on CI if test.only is present in the code.
retries,Number of times to retry a failed test.
workers,Number of concurrent worker processes.
reporter,"Reporter type: 'list', 'dot', 'html', 'junit', or 'json'."
outputDir,Folder for test artifacts like screenshots and traces.
globalSetup,Path to a file that runs once before all tests.
globalTeardown,Path to a file that runs once after all tests.

2. The use Object (Context & Browser Options)
Property,Description
baseURL,The base URL used for page.goto('/').
browserName,"'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'."
headless,Whether to run the browser in headless mode (true/false).
viewport,"Browser window size (e.g., { width: 1280, height: 720 })."
screenshot,"When to take screenshots: 'on', 'off', 'only-on-failure'."
video,"When to record video: 'on', 'retain-on-failure', 'off'."
trace,"When to record traces: 'on', 'on-first-retry', 'retain-on-failure'."
storageState,Path to a JSON file containing cookies/localStorage (for auth).
actionTimeout,Timeout for actions like click() or type().
permissions,"Array of granted permissions (e.g., ['geolocation'])."
ignoreHTTPSErrors,Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation.

3. The projects Array (Specific Environments)
Property,Description
name,"Unique name for the project (e.g., 'chromium', 'Mobile Safari')."
use,Overrides the global use settings for this specific project.
testMatch,Filter tests for this project using glob patterns.
testIgnore,Patterns to ignore tests for this specific project.
dependencies,"List of projects that must run before this one (e.g., a setup project)."
teardown,A project to run after this project finishes.
retries,Overrides the global retry count for this project only.
