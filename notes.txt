1. Identity & Relationships
These keys define what the project is and how it relates to other projects (like setup and teardown).

name: A unique string name for the project. Used for filtering in the CLI (e.g., --project=firefox).

dependencies: An array of project names that must run and pass before this project starts. Great for global setup (e.g., dependencies: ['setup']).

teardown: The name of a project that should run after this project finishes. Useful for database cleanup.

2. Test Discovery & Selection
These keys control which specific files or tests belong to this project.

testDir: The directory where this project's tests are located.

testMatch: A glob pattern, regular expression, or an array of them to include specific files.

testIgnore: A glob pattern or regular expression to exclude specific files.

grep: A regular expression to filter tests by their title.

grepInvert: A regular expression to exclude tests by their title.

3. Execution & Retries
These keys control how the tests are physically executed.

use: An object containing browser and context options (e.g., browserName, headless, viewport, baseURL). This is the most commonly used key.

retries: The maximum number of times to retry a failed test in this project.

timeout: The maximum time (in milliseconds) a single test in this project can run.

fullyParallel: A boolean (true/false) to decide if tests in this project should run in parallel.

4. Output & Metadata
These keys manage the artifacts and data generated by the tests.

outputDir: The folder where artifacts like screenshots and videos are saved for this project.

metadata: An object for custom data you want to associate with the project (visible in some reporters).

snapshotDir: The base directory for reference snapshots.

snapshotPathTemplate: A template string to customize where screenshots/snapshots are saved.



Pattern,Where it looks
*.setup.js,Only in the root folder (does not look inside folders).
tests/**/*.setup.js,Only inside the tests folder and its subdirectories.
"**/*.{setup,teardown}.js",Finds files ending in either .setup.js or .teardown.js.
